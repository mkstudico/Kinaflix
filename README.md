Prerequisites
Before setting up Kinaflix locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)
Vercel CLI (npm install -g vercel)
Git
A Firebase account with a project set up
A Google Drive account (for movie streaming links, optional)
A WhatsApp group link (for sharing, optional)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kinaflix.git
cd kinaflix


Install Dependencies:Since Kinaflix is a static site, no npm packages are required for the frontend. However, install Vercel CLI for deployment:
npm install -g vercel


Set Up Firebase:

Go to Firebase Console.
Create a new project (e.g., kinaflix).
Enable Firestore, Authentication (Email/Password), and Analytics.
Copy your Firebase config object (found in Project Settings > General > Your apps > Web app):const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};


Create a .env file in the project root and add your Firebase config:VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_URL
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID


Note: Kinaflix uses client-side Firebase, so the config is embedded in index.html and see.html. For security, consider server-side rendering or environment variable injection in production.


Configure Firestore Rules:

In Firebase Console, go to Firestore > Rules and add:rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /movies/{movieId} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    match /series/{seriesId} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    match /comments/{commentId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /watchlists/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}


Deploy rules:firebase deploy --only firestore:rules




Set Up Vercel:

Link your project to Vercel:vercel


Follow prompts to configure (use defaults for a static site).
Add environment variables in Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables, using the .env values.



Running Locally

Start a Local Server:Since Kinaflix is a static site, use Vercel‚Äôs development server:
vercel dev

Alternatively, use a simple HTTP server:
npx http-server .

Open http://localhost:8080 (or the port shown).

Test Features:

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ for the homepage.
Visit http://localhost:8080/see.html?id=<movieId> to test a movie page (replace <movieId> with a valid Firestore movies document ID).
Ensure Firebase Authentication is working by logging in via login.html (if implemented).
